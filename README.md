# SharpZebraStandard
a .NETStandard 2.0 library that simplifies printing to Zebra printers in their native EPL2/ZPL languages without needing to know EPL2 or ZPL. 

This project is designed to be a drop in replacement for the sharpzebra library (only namespace changed).  This version allows printing to Networked Zebra printers from any NetStandard2.0 project. USB and Networked (Spool) printers are still supported with the DesktopPrinting addon (.Net Framework 4.7.2)

Additional resources are found at the [sharpzebra repo](https://github.com/rkone/sharpzebra), including a [quickstart guide](https://github.com/rkone/sharpzebra/wiki)
